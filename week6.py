'''1. Write a function that accepts a positive integer as a parameter and then returns a
representation of that number in binary (base 2).
Hint: This is in many ways a trick question. Think! '''

# def binary(n):
#     if n <= 0:
#         raise ValueError("Please enter positive number")
#     return format(n, 'b')
# print(binary(2))  


'''2. Write and test a function that takes an integer as its parameter and returns the
factors of that integer. (A factor is an integer which can be multiplied by another to
yield the original).'''

# storage = []
# def factor(number):
#     for i in range(1, number + 1):
#         if number % i == 0:  # Check if i is a factor of n
#             storage.append(i) #Append the value in the list i.e in storage
#     return storage 
# print(factor(120))

'''3. Write and test a function that determines if a given integer is a prime number. A
prime number is an integer greater than 1 that cannot be produced by multiplying
two other integers. '''

# def prime_number(number):
#     if number <= 1:
#         return False
#     for i in range(2, number):
#         if (number % i) == 0:
#             return False
#         else:
#             return True
# print(prime_number(4))  


'''4. Computers are commonly used in encryption. A very simple form of encryption
(more accurately "obfuscation") would be to remove the spaces from a message
and reverse the resulting string. Write, and test, a function that takes a string
containing a message and "encrypts" it in this way. '''


# def enc():
#     message = input("Enter a message: ")
#     enc_message = message.replace(" ", "")[::-1] # Remove spaces and reverse the string
#     return enc_message
# print(enc())
